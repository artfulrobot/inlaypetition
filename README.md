# Petition "Inlay" for adding petitions to remote websites

Add high performance petitions, configured in CiviCRM, to your separate public website.

- Please see [Inlay](https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/inlay) for an introduction to the technology this is based on.

- Note this is currently fairly generic, but I reserve the right to bend it to my client's wishes at any point. *Inlay* provides a way to develop customised remote forms; this is one example of its use.
